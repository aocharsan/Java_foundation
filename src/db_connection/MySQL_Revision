What is MySQL?
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
Stores data in tables with rows and columns.
Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to create, manage, and query relational databases.

Key Features:
Relational database with support for foreign keys and constraints.
ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) — ensures reliable transactions.
Scalable and widely used with Java applications.

Database → Collection of related tables
Table → Collection of rows (records) and columns (fields)
Row / Record → One data entry
Column / Field → Attribute of data

Key Concepts for Java Developers:

Primary Key → uniquely identifies a row.
Foreign Key → ensures referential integrity between tables.

Indexes improve query performance (like a book’s index).

Constraints to enforce rules at DB level.
PRIMARY KEY → Unique identifier
FOREIGN KEY → Link to another table
NOT NULL → Cannot be empty
UNIQUE → Unique value
CHECK → Restrict values
DEFAULT → Default value if not provided

CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 10000,
    UNIQUE (name)
   );



SQL Commands
a) DDL (Data Definition Language) -----> Used to define or modify structure of tables/databases.

Command                        Purpose	                           Example
CREATE DATABASE	             Create a new DB	            CREATE DATABASE employee_db;
DROP DATABASE              	 Delete DB	                    DROP DATABASE employee_db;
CREATE TABLE               	 Create table	                CREATE TABLE employee (id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(50), salary DECIMAL(10,2));
ALTER TABLE	                 Modify table	                ALTER TABLE employee ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);
DROP TABLE	                 Delete table	                DROP TABLE employee;

b) DML (Data Manipulation Language) -----> Used to work with data inside tables.

Command	      Purpose	           Example
INSERT	    Add records	      INSERT INTO employee (name, department, salary) VALUES ('Sanket', 'IT', 50000);
UPDATE  	Modify records	  UPDATE employee SET salary=55000 WHERE id=1;
DELETE	    Remove records	  DELETE FROM employee WHERE id=2;

c) DQL (Data Query Language) ------> Used to read/query data.

Command	                 Purpose	           Example
SELECT	                Fetch data	     SELECT * FROM employee;
SELECT with condition	Filter rows	     SELECT name, salary FROM employee WHERE department='IT';
ORDER BY            	Sort results     SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC;
LIMIT	                Limit rows	     SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT 5;

d) DCL (Data Control Language) ------> Used for permissions & security.

Command   	 Purpose                     	Example
GRANT	   Give privileges    	GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employee_db.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
REVOKE	   Remove privileges	REVOKE INSERT ON employee_db.* FROM 'user'@'localhost';

e) TCL (Transaction Control Language)

Command      Purpose	         Example
COMMIT  	Save changes	      COMMIT;
ROLLBACK	Undo changes	      ROLLBACK;
SAVEPOINT	Create checkpoint	  SAVEPOINT;

| Join Type    |              Purpose                |                                 Example                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INNER JOIN` | Rows matching in both tables        | `SELECT e.name, d.dept_name FROM employee e INNER JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;` |
| `LEFT JOIN`  | All rows from left + matching right | `SELECT e.name, d.dept_name FROM employee e LEFT JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;`  |
| `RIGHT JOIN` | All rows from right + matching left | `RIGHT JOIN` similar                                                                           |
| `FULL JOIN`  | All rows from both tables           | `FULL OUTER JOIN` (not in MySQL, use UNION)                                                    |

Aggregate Functions :
  COUNT() → count rows
  SUM() → sum values
  AVG() → average
  MAX() / MIN() → highest / lowest

Example:
   SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
   FROM employee
   GROUP BY department;

Next Goal:
  Learn joins and subqueries → essential for backend logic.
  Understand transactions for consistent data.
  Start thinking about mapping tables to Java objects (later JPA/Hibernate).


WHERE → filter rows
ORDER BY → sort results
LIMIT → limit rows
COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN()
GROUP BY → group rows
HAVING → filter aggregated results

|                 Clause                      | When it Executes             |               Notes                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `WHERE`                                     | After FROM/JOIN              | Filters individual rows                 |
| `GROUP BY`                                  | After WHERE                  | Groups rows together                    |
| Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`) | During SELECT after grouping | Applied to each group                   |
| `HAVING`                                    | After GROUP BY               | Filters groups, not individual rows     |
| `ORDER BY`                                  | Last                         | Sorts the final result                  |
| `LIMIT`                                     | Last                         | Restricts number of rows returned       |

  e.g.
  SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM employee
  WHERE salary > 20000          -- filter rows first
  GROUP BY department            -- group by department
  HAVING AVG(salary) > 40000    -- filter groups after aggregation
  ORDER BY avg_salary DESC       -- sort final result
  LIMIT 5;                       -- take top 5 rows

✅ Key Tip:
   WHERE → filters rows before grouping
   HAVING → filters groups after aggregation
   ORDER BY → always last
   LIMIT → always last
